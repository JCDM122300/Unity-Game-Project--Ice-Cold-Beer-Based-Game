# Style Explanation
So my overall look for the game is going to be outer space themed where miniature blackholes are going to be the holes, the ball is going to either be a small asteroid or a futuristic type spherical object, the ramp is going to look like a steel platform or another furtristic looking object (including the walls), and the background is going to be deep space for now.
