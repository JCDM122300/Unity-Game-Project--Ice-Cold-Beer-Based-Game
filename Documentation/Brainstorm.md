# Brainstorm
1. Player can use analog sticks on game pad to emulate arcade joysticks 
1. We want to come up with a mouse and keyboard control sceme for players without a gamepad/controller
1. Could it work as a mobile game? What would the controls be? You could tilt the phone left and right and control the character using keys on the screen
1. How can I customize the theme? Obviously not going to be about beer...
1. David wants us to make a first playable prototype as a TOP PRIORITY before we get carried away with art and story stuff.
