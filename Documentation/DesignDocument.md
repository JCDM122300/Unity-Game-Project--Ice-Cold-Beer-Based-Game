We made a physical prototype of the ramp and decided it will move along with the two underlying "things" kind of like a shelf.
We know the shelf will have to eventually be fastened to the things, otherwise it'll slide off.
No matter our solution to the slide off problem, we need to create the things that move up and down along with player input.
The first step is to create one thing that moves up with player input.
(what button should it be?)
We know that we're developing on mouse and keyboard, so no matter what platform we eventually release on, we have to have keyboard controls so we can test the game on PC.
Commonly, games use WASD< or the arrow keys, so we could use those.
Another option could be to use
