# Unity-Game-Project--Ice-Cold-Beer-Based-Game
Remember to make a playable character to control so you can avoid the holes. Also a repository for ITGD Project #1

This is going to be a game where the player dodges holes by dashing, rolling, jumping, and by using items all while a platorm is raising up and tilting left to right. For additional challenge, the speed of which it tilts and/or rises can change later on in the level. (Upgrades to player might be a consideration as well)
